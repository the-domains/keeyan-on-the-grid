# About Me

A short bio & my story.

---

I help companies and individuals in leadership roles achieve their full potential and aim for long-term growth. As a young entrepreneur, I can offer unique insight into the latest and greatest business technology tools and market positioning to offer my customers added value. I'm aware of the challenges that the new digital "playing-field" has for SMB's, and have developed a rigorous and tested methodology (with Kworld Standard, my company) to help re-shape organizational flow in a way that takes full advantage of the power of technology in their business process.

Through my various ventures, ranging from a stint as a founder of a fast-growing startup, to the President & CEO of Kworld Standard, and as a partner at Go Tikki Travel, I have acquired cross-industry knowledge and experience which allow me to see and implement unconventional but highly effective and cost-friendly solutions to everyday business problems.

I currently reside in beautiful Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
