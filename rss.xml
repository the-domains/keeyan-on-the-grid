Most recently we've been digging through four new offerings and each is very different from the next.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8dbd52c022b397f706e88ffffb31a04f102faa7c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bon Marché, San Francisco, USA.</h1><p>Among the eateries revitalising San Francisco's once-gritty Mid-Market neighborhood into the city's most buzzy food and drinks corridor is Bon Marché, a sunny Californian take on Le Marais. This 7500-square-foot space combines a café, a brewery, an oyster bar, a full-service restaurant, and even a flower shop that doubles as a stage for live jazz at night.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f67536b56e8543128b8b1122f673dc5d50a01f50.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Clever Headrest That Could Make Flying Actually Bearable</h1><p>There are many reasons to hate flying economy.

Yet few places in the world brim with as much life as Cuba, a contrast drawn sharper amid its faded grandeur.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/196de034f71ac2612a2898c9ace08482d0e1afa6.jpg"></article>]]></description>
